Mashing aforementioned assets up, rig building, snow sculpting,
lidar scanning, post-processing the data, coding, animating etc. by Nupo.

Some tools used when making this demo (in approximate order of usage):
- GNSS-Stylus to collect GNSS & lidar-data, constructing point clouds and
creating "paths" for the lidar scanner & camera rig. Modified version
used to generate data to better visualize and animate the lidar scans.
- MeshLab to post-process those point clouds into 3D-objects.
- Godot Engine to make the demo itself.
- GIMP: to create the solar cell texture and generic gfx-editing.
- Material Maker to create the "golden" (=polyimide) surface for the satellite.
- Blender to create the satellite wreck main body.

These are all free and open source software (FOSS).
Thanks to everyone for sharing.
