A demo originally released at Revision/Instanssi 2022

"Final"(?) Windows-version released 12-Mar-2024

Not tested too thoroughly. Works on my laptop with Nvidia RTX-2060.
Also works (low FPS) on my older laptop with Nvidia GTX-850M
Quite recent dev-version worked on Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 (low FPS) with 
some Intel's integrated graphics.

Now with two flavors:
Great leaders (extended depression remix)
Pompous maximus (extended progression remix)
