("The Addon Repository for the 3D Space Simulator Celestia").
From the original ReadMe.txt: "This model was made by
Michael Powell with textures by BJ West, I had help also from
Martin Charest with the textures."

This planet generator was used to generate texture for the textured planet:\

Generated with command:\
planet -o test.bmp -s 0.41 -w 4096 -h 4096 -c
